              welcome to werewolf! <br>
              <b>here's how the game works:</b> you will be randomly placed on one of three teams and given 
              one of the roles listed below. once all players are given a role <i>the night</i> begins. during the night you will
              perform an action dependent on your role (the game will tell you waht to do). at the end of the night, you
              and the other players must vote on who you want to get rid of. the person you want to vote out is based on your role 
              at <b>the end</b> of the night. this means your role could be different from what it was at the beginning - you have to
              try to figure that out. if you vote out the right person with respect to your role, you win!

            <p><b>note:</b> <i>you may not be playing with all the roles listed - this depends on the number of players. there will always
              be three more roles in play than the number of players - there are three "center" cards which no player recieves at the beginning
              of the night, but may be useful in deducing who is what role in the end. The roles are listed in a particular order - if you have
              n players, the first n + 3 roles in this list will be in play in some form.</i></p>
